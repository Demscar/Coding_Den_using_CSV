git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-coding-den.git
```
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE or compiler.

Usage 📋
🔒 When running the program, you will be prompted to either login as a user or staff (admin).

🏠 If you select the user login option, you will need to provide your room number to proceed.

📝 The system will then display the user options menu, where you can order food, view the menu, view your bill, and check out.

🔐 If you select the staff login option, you will need to enter the admin password to proceed.

🔧 The admin/staff options menu will allow you to manage guests, add or remove items from the menu, and view the guest list.

Notes 📝
🏨 The room numbers and passwords for admin access are stored in separate files. Make sure to update these files as needed.

🍽️ The menu items and prices are stored in the menu.csv file. You can modify this file to add or remove food items.

🖥️ The project is developed for a Windows environment. If you are using a different operating system, some functions may not work correctly.
